# Reimagine Project

## Overview

This repository contains a full-stack application with a backend built using Express.js and a frontend built using React.

## Landing Page Documentation

### Architecture & Design Philosophy

The Reimagine landing page represents a modern, immersive iPhone showcase built with cutting-edge web technologies. Designed to mirror Apple's premium aesthetic, the landing page combines elegant animations, responsive design, and interactive elements to create an engaging user experience that reflects the sophistication of the iPhone products being featured.

### Key Components Structure

The landing page is constructed using a modular component architecture centered around the `Home.jsx` component, which orchestrates five primary sections:

**Hero Section** - The focal point featuring a dynamic video background with adaptive responsiveness. This section immediately captures attention with high-quality iPhone footage and smooth GSAP animations that fade in content progressively. The hero adapts between desktop and mobile video sources automatically based on screen size.

**Highlights Section** - Showcases key iPhone features through interactive content blocks. Each highlight uses carefully choreographed animations to reveal product capabilities, creating an engaging scrolling experience that maintains user interest while providing essential product information.

**3D Model Viewer** - An innovative Three.js integration that allows users to interact with photorealistic iPhone models. This section demonstrates the device from multiple angles with smooth rotation controls, color variants, and detailed material rendering that brings the product to life in the browser.

**Features Grid** - A comprehensive overview of iPhone capabilities organized in visually appealing cards. Each feature card combines striking imagery with concise descriptions, utilizing CSS Grid for optimal layout across all device sizes while maintaining visual hierarchy.

**How It Works** - Educational content that guides users through iPhone functionality using step-by-step animations and clear visual indicators. This section builds confidence in potential customers by demonstrating ease of use and highlighting innovative technologies.

### Technical Implementation

The landing page leverages several modern web technologies for optimal performance and user experience. **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** powers smooth, hardware-accelerated animations throughout the page, including scroll-triggered sequences and interactive hover effects. **Three.js** enables the 3D iPhone model rendering with realistic materials and lighting. **React Router** provides seamless navigation between product pages without full page refreshes.

The responsive design system ensures consistent experiences across devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. CSS Grid and Flexbox create flexible layouts that adapt fluidly to different screen sizes, while the color scheme maintains Apple's signature aesthetic with carefully chosen typography and spacing that enhances readability and visual appeal.

### User Experience Features

Interactive elements throughout the page provide immediate feedback and encourage exploration. Hover effects on product cards reveal additional information, smooth scrolling between sections maintains engagement, and the 3D model viewer allows hands-on product exploration. The navigation system includes breadcrumbs and clear call-to-action buttons that guide users toward purchase decisions.

Performance optimization ensures fast loading times through lazy loading of images and videos, optimized asset delivery, and efficient JavaScript bundling. The page maintains 60fps animations while delivering rich interactive content, creating a premium experience that matches the quality of the products being showcased.

This comprehensive landing page serves as both a product showcase and a demonstration of modern web development capabilities, effectively bridging the gap between digital marketing and immersive brand experience.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. You can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Node.js Installation

1. **Download Node.js**:

   - Go to [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system.

2. **Install Node.js**:

   - Run the installer and follow the prompts. The installer will also install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), the Node.js package manager.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open your terminal and type the following commands to verify the installation:
     ```
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

## Backend - Express.js

### Features

- RESTful API endpoints
- Database integration (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- Authentication and Authorization
- Error handling

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/Rtarun3606k/Reimagine.git
   cd Reimagine/backend

2. **Install dependencies**:
   npm install

3. **Set up environment variables**:

- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the necessary environment variables. Example:
  ```
  PORT=5000
  DB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_database_connection_string
  ```

4. **Run the server**:
   npm start

The backend server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.
